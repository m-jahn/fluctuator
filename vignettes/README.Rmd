An Interface to Import and Modify SVG (XML) Graphic Files in R.

## Description

SVG is the primary choice for scalable, open-source graphic files. This packages provides a simple interface to import SVG graphic files in R, modify these in a programmatic way, and export the files again. The purpose of this package is to overlay scientific data on medium or large scale network representations, which is too laborious and time-consuming to do manually. SVG Graphics have to be drawn beforehand, for example using [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/). Objects ("nodes") are than identified and modified using unique IDs/label in R. The fantastic [Escher](https://escher.github.io/#/) app follows a similar approach, where a metabolic network is first drawn on a canvas, and then used as a template to overlay metabolic, flux, gene expression or other data.
Options to customize the metabolic maps are too restricted.

Package info:

- Maintainer: Michael Jahn, Science for Life Lab, Stockholm
- License: GPL-3
- Depends: R (>= 3.5.0)
- Imports: `methods`, `XML`, `dplyr`

## Installation

To install the package directly from github, use the following function from the `devtools` package in your R session:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("m-jahn/fluctuator")
```


## Usage

### Make an SVG template (with Inkscape)

The first step is to create an SVG file depicting e.g. a metabolic network. Inkscape is a free, open source software for vector images and natively supports SVG. Every item (node) that is created gets a cryptic label in Inkscape, such as `path-123-456-0-1`. All we need to do is to open the object dialog and change labels to more human readable names (see picture). These are later used to identify objects in R. I recommend using different prefixes for different types of objects, like `node_XYZ` for the nodes of a network, and `reaction_XYZ` for connections between nodes.

### Read SVG

We can then import the SVG file in R using `read_svg()`. The resulting object of class `XMLsvg` has two slots, the original XML structure and a feature table with all graphical objects (nodes) and their attributes.

```{r, message = FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(fluctuator)

# import example map
SVG <- read_svg("../images/example_network.svg")

# show class
class(SVG)

# access summary table of objects/nodes
head(SVG@summary)
```
### Get attributes of SVG

We can search for certain nodes in the SVG and display their attributes. Note that nodes are objects, not to be confused with single points of a path.

```{r}
get_attributes(SVG, node = "node_1", attr = c("label", "style"))
get_attributes(SVG, node = "ABC", attr = c("label", "style"))
```

### Change attributes of SVG

The most important feature of this package is to change SVG attributes using the `set_attributes()` function.
The function takes four important arguments: the name (`label`) of the `node` whose attributes should be changed, and which corresponds to Inkscape object names. The `attribute` that is supposed to be changed (e.g. `style`). And a pattern + replacement that modifies the character value of the attribute.

In this example we change the fill color of `node_1` to red. Then we also change the thickness of the two arrows (reactions) `ABC` and `DEF`.

```{r}
SVG <- set_attributes(SVG, node = "node_1", attr = "style",
  pattern = "fill:#808080", replacement = "fill:#FF0000")

SVG <- set_attributes(SVG, node = c("ABC", "DEF"), attr = "style",
  pattern = "stroke-width:1.32291663", replacement = c("stroke-width:2.5", "stroke-width:0.5"))
```

### Export modified SVG file

Modified SVG files can be saved to disk using `write_svg()`.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
write_svg(SVG, file = "../images/example_network_mod.svg")
```

### Real world example

Let's import a reduced network of the central carbon metabolism of the bacterium *Cupriavidus necator*. We can inspect the Inkscape names of all reactions in the summary table (column `label`).


```{r}
SVG2 <- read_svg("../images/central_metabolism.svg")
head(SVG2@summary)
```

The network has objects for metabolites, reactions, and reaction text labels. We want to modify thickness of arrows representing flux through reactions. We import a table with flux data matching the reactions in the SVG file.

```{r}
data(metabolic_flux)
head(metabolic_flux)
```

Then we inspect the style of the nodes that we want to change, and find the text bit for `stroke-width`.

```{r}
get_attributes(SVG2, node = "GAPDH") %>% pull(style)
```

As some reactions have very high flux and others no flux at all, we apply a square root transformation to the fluxes so that stroke width is more balanced.

```{r}
metabolic_flux_for <- metabolic_flux %>%
  filter(substrate == "formate") %>%
  mutate(stroke_width = 0.2 + 0.2*sqrt(abs(flux_mmol_gDCW_h)))

SVG2 <- set_attributes(SVG2,
  node = metabolic_flux_for$reaction, attr = "style",
  pattern = "stroke-width:[0-9]+\\.[0-9]+",
  replacement = paste0("stroke-width:", metabolic_flux_for$stroke_width))
```

We can also change the color of all non-zero fluxes to green.

```{r}
reactions_green <- metabolic_flux %>%
  filter(substrate == "formate", flux_mmol_gDCW_h != 0) %>%
  pull(reaction)

SVG2 <- set_attributes(SVG2,
  node = reactions_green, attr = "style",
  pattern = "stroke:#808080",
  replacement = "stroke:#008A12")
```

Export the modified SVG file.

```{r}
write_svg(SVG2, file = "../images/central_metabolism_mod.svg")
```
